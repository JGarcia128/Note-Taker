## Express.js: Note Taker

## Note Taker

Created an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.

## User Story

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
